# Teachers Helping Teachers


## Project Summary

Teachers Helping Teachers is a file-share application that allows teachers to upload or download lesson plans for free. While there are a number of sites and applications that exits with this capability, many are pay-per-lesson or subscription based. As a former teacher, I wanted to create this app to allow the free flow of ideas to assist new and veteran teachers alike, allowing new teachers to learn and veterans to share their wealth of knowledge.


## Installing

Before beginning with the installing of the front end of this application, you should first set up the back end.


## Link to Back End Repo

https://github.com/eric-klimowich/teachers_help_teachers_backend

Once the back end is set up, you can fork and clone the front end.

Be sure the back end is up and running first:

```
cd teachers_help_teachers_backend
rails db:create && rails db:migrate
rails s
```

Once installed, follow the instructions to start up front end:

```
cd teachers_help_teachers_frontend
npm start
```

The back end will be running on http://localhost:3000

After
```
npm start
```
be sure to say "Yes" to starting the front end on a different server:
http://localhost:3001 or a server of your choosing.
